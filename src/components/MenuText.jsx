      A burger is a delicious creation that starts with a juicy beef patty,
      cooked to perfection. It's layered with melted cheese, fresh lettuce, ripe
      tomatoes, and tangy pickles. Add a slice of onion, a dollop of ketchup,
      and a smear of mustard, all nestled between a soft, toasted bun. Every
      bite is a burst of flavor!
    </div>
